# 'You Draw It' -- Example
 
 **Summary:** Simple RShiny application example for the 'You Draw It' feature.
 
 ‘You Draw It’ is a feature that allows users to interact with a chart directly by drawing a line on their computer screen with a mouse. Originally introduced by the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/05/28/upshot/you-draw-it-how-family-income-affects-childrens-college-chances.html) in 2015 for the purpose of interactive reading, we aimed to adapt and demonstrate the use of the ‘You Draw It’ method as a tool for interactive testing of graphics.
